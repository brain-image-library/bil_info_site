      <h1>Computing and Visualization</H1>
      <p>The Brain Image Library provides several ways to access data without having to download it: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>BIL Login Node:</b> All users of the BIL systems have ssh access to the BIL login node</li>
	<li><b>BIL Computational Cluster:</b> The BIL Computational cluster consists of eight nodes 
	   with 3 terabytes of RAM. The computational cluster runs SLURM and is avaiable for 
           both batch and interactive access from the BIL login node.</li>       
        <li><b>BIL VM System:</b>The BIL VM system is a flexible resource that is made up of several large
          memory machines equiped with modern GPUS. The VM system is remote desktop capable, can host 
          user-licenced commercial, and can host web gateways to provide project-specific data views, support
          web-based visualization, and compute-in-place applications.</li> 
        <li><b>Bridges-2:</b> Bridges-2 is a high performance computing system designed 
          to support familiar, convenient software and environments for both traditional and non-traditional 
          HPC users. Its richly-connected set of interacting systems offers exceptional flexibility for data
          analytics, simulation, workflows and gateways, leveraging interactivity, parallel computing, Spark
          and Hadoop.</li>
        <li><b>NeoCortex:</b> Neocortex is a Cerebras CS-1 system.</li>
        <li><b>Napari-bil-data-viewer:</b> A plugin for the popular Napari image viewer that allows
          single-click visualization of thousands of datasets at BIL.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr /> 
      <div id="login"></div>
      <h3>BIL Login Node</h3>    
        <p>The BIL login node provides command line (ssh terminal) access to BIL data. Everyone who requests
          a BIL account has access to the login node using their BIL Username and Password. The login node is 
          not intended for heavy computation or visualization, but rather to provide convenient shell access to
	  BIL data and enable interactive and batch use of the <i>BIL Computational Cluster</i>. The BIL 
	  computational cluster provides a suitable resource for both computation and visualization.</p>
        <p>To request a BIL account and gain access to the login node, follow 
          <a href="http://www.brainimagelibrary.org/account.html">these instructions</a> to create an 
	        account. Then, send email to <i>bil-support@psc.edu</i> along with your ACCESS Portal Account 
          and the subject "Access to BIL Login Node for data exploration". You will receive an email message 
          once access has been enabled with instructions to set your password. Please allow 24 hours for access
          to be granted.</p> 
        <p> Once access has been granted you may connect using ssh to login.brainimagelibrary.org and log in 
          with your username/password combination.</p>
 
      <h3>BIL VM System</h3>
			  <p>The BIL VM system is a flexible resource that is made up of several large
	        memory machines equiped with modern GPUS. The VM system is remote desktop capable, can host 
          user-licenced commercial, and can host web gateways to provide project-specific data views, support
	        web-based visualization, and compute-in-place applications.</p>
	      <p>The VM system can be set up to support two different remote-desktop models: X2Go and for high-resolution
		      graphics TGX.</a>
        <p>There is a rich suite of open-source and commercial software availiable on the VMs through the 
				  modules package. The suite available includes:  C/C++, Java, Python, R, Matlab, Fiji, Vaa3d, and others.
				<p>VMs can also be configured to host web gateways to provide project specific views of data in BIL and 
					to support visualization, APIs, and compute-in-place applications.</p>
			  <p>Since customization is involved, existing BIL users should send email to <i>bil-support@psc.edu</i> 
				  describing their proposed VM usage. BIL staff will then contact the enailer and set up a time to 
          discuss various VM options in more detail. </p>
      
      <H3>Bridges-2 HPC Access</h3> 
          <p>The Brain Image Library data (the /bil filesystem) is directly accessable
            on the Bridges-2 Platform (bridges2.psc.edu)</b></p>
          <p>The Bridges-2 system  is a high performance computing system designed to support
            familiar, convenient software and environments for both traditional and non-traditional 
            HPC users. Bridges-2 is the ideal system for resource-intensive applications as well 
            as applications targeting HPC + AI + Data. Additional information about Bridges-2 
            capabilities can be found 
            <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/">here.</a> In addition there is a  
            <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/user-guide-2/">Bridges-2 User Guide</a>

          </p>
          <p>Multiple users can use a single allocation. To be added to an existing allocation by 
            the allocation owner, you must have an ACCESS Portal account
            (<a href="https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create 
            one here if you don't already have one</a>); once you do, the 
            <a href="https://allocations.access-ci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allocation 
            owner can submit a request through the Portal to add you to the allocation</a>.<p>

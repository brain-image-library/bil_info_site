Accessing the Brain Image Library Globus Connect Server service (update: 2024-01-05)
</head>
<body>
<p>
Globus data service for the Brain Image Library has been updated to use Globus Connect Server 5.
<p>
The most significant changes are the method for mapping your institution or organization's   identity to your BIL/PSC username, and the name of the Globus "collection" (not to be confused with a BIL collection) that you connect to via the Globus service.
<p>
In the past, we asked you to provide both your CILogon certificate subject and ePPN, for the identity that you want to use to authenticate to the BIL Globus service with. We no longer require the CILogon certificate subject, but we do need the CILogon ePPN. If you have provided this to us in the past, then we should have it already in our database. Otherwise, please login with your preferred identity at https://cilogon.org/ and send us an e-mail to bil-support@psc.edu with your name, institution, and the value of the ePPN field under "User Attributes" from the CILogon website.
<p>
Once your ePPN has been mapped to your BIL/PSC username, you will be able to login via the Globus website at https://globus.org/ - select the LOG IN button at the top-right to begin.

<p>
From the drop-down list, find the organization for the identity associated with the ePPN we have mapped for you. This could either be ACCESS (XSEDE), or your institution (e.g. Carnegie Mellon University). To narrow down possibilities, you can start typing the name of the organization in this field. After you select the organization for the identity that you want to authenticate with, select the Continue button to proceed.
<br>

<p>
You will be redirected to your organization's login page, where you enter the account name, password, and possibly also complete an additional two-factor authentication (e.g. DUO) to login.

<p>
Upon successful authentication to your organization, your browser will show the Globus File Manager page. The next step will be to connect to the Brain Image Library service.
<br>

<p>
Click in the field labelled "Collection" (the Globus term for a remote data site), and start typing "Brain Image Library". This should bring up the new Globus collection labelled "Brain Image Library /bil filesystem" on the Brain Image Library Globus Connect Server 5 Endpoint. Select it to proceed.
<br>

<p>
The first time that you connect to this Globus collection, you may be asked to provide consent to use your identity to authenticate to it. Select "Continue" to proceed.
<br>

<p>
There may be more than one identity mapped to your BIL/PSC username. Select the identity that you used to login to Globus with, and then select "Continue" to proceed.
<br>
<img alt="Globus select identity" width="50%" height="50%" src="07-globus-select-identity.png" />
<p>
The Globus service will then ask you to allow the service to use your identity to facilitate activities including file transfers, file management, and remote access to data. Select "Allow" to proceed.
<br>

<p>
Once you have allowed the Globus service to employ your identity to authenticate you to the BIL Globus service, you will be connected and arrive at the Path /bil. You can navigate with clicks or by typing the path to your desired location in the Path field.

<p>
When you are done with your Globus session, we recommend logging out completely. This is a two-step process: Select the LOGOUT icon toward the bottom of the left sidebar.
<br>
<img alt="Globus logout icon" width="50%" height="50%" src="10-globus-logout-icon.png" />
<p>
Clicking on the LOGOUT icon logs you out of the Globus file manager web app. To logout from the Globus service, select the Globus ID "Log Out" link.
<br>
<img alt="Globus logout id" width="50%" height="50%" src="11-globus-logout-id.png" />
<p>
Clicking on the Globus ID "Log out" link will bring up a separate tab that shows that you have logged out of the Globus web service completely. Both tabs can be closed at this point.

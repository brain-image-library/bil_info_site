<H1>Data Submission</H1>
	    
<h2 id="Overview" data-id="Overview" style=""><span>Overview</span></h2><p><span>The data submission portal enables laboratories to submit data to the Brain Image Library. The key processes to submit data are:</span></p><ol style="padding-left: 2em;">
<li><span>Create an account.</span></li>
<li><span>Log in to the data submission portal.</span></li>
<li><span>Create a submission: A submission is a collection of image sets associated with the metadata.</span></li>
<li><span>Upload image data: Because this is the time-limiting step, we suggest this step be started before uploading metadata for the submission.</span></li>
<li><span>Upload metadata: Submission metadata can be uploaded through the portal in spreadsheet format.</span></li>
<li><span>Validate data: Users request to validate the data and correct any errors discovered.</span></li>
<li><span>Data is made public: Once data is validated and metadata is curated, the submission is made public.</span></li>

</div><p><span>The PI dashboard allows PIs and Data Managers to define and manage projects. This dashboard will allow the PI to add authorized users to the project and see the status of in-progress, unsuccessful, and successful submissions, regardless of the users who uploaded and submitted the data.</span></p><p><span>You will need to create a project that all your BIL submissions will belong to. Your projects and sub-projects can represent different grants and different experimental projects and are a way for you to organize data being submitted at different times. You will only need to create a project/sub-project once, not every time you submit data to BIL.</span></p><p><span>Each project at BIL operates based on a “Parent” to “Child” relationship, similar to a family tree.

<li><span>Once your ePPN has been mapped to your BIL/PSC username, you will be able to log in via the Globus website</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Once your ePPN has been mapped to BIL user, you can upload via Globus:</span></p>
<ol style="padding-left: 2em;">
<li>
<p><span>Login at </span><a href="https://globus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>https://globus.org/</span></a><span> - select the LOG IN button at the top-right to begin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>From the drop-down list, find the organization for the identity associated with the ePPN we have mapped for you. This could either be ACCESS (XSEDE), or your institution (e.g. Carnegie Mellon University). After you select the organization for the identity that you want to authenticate with, select the Continue button to proceed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>You will be redirected to your organization's login page, where you enter the account name, password, and possibly also complete an additional two-factor authentication (e.g. DUO) to log in.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Upon successful authentication to your organization, your browser will show the Globus File Manager page where you can connect to the Brain Image Library service.</span><br>
<span>Click in the field labeled "Collection" (the Globus term for a remote data site), and start typing "Brain Image Library". This should bring up the new Globus collection labeled "Brain Image Library /bil filesystem" on the Brain Image Library Globus Connect Server 5 Endpoint. Select it to proceed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The first time that you connect to this Globus collection, you may be asked to provide consent to use your identity to authenticate to it. Select "Continue" to proceed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>There may be more than one identity mapped to your BIL/PSC username. Select the identity that you used to login to Globus with, and then select "Continue" to proceed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The Globus service will then ask you to allow the service to use your identity to facilitate activities including file transfers, file management, and remote access to data. Select "Allow" to proceed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Once you have allowed the Globus service to employ your identity to authenticate you to the BIL Globus service, you will be connected and arrive at the Path /bil. You can navigate with clicks or by typing the path to your desired location in the Path field.</span><br>
<span>Globus path to /bil/lz</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>When you are done with your Globus session, we recommend logging out completely. This is a two-step process: Select the LOGOUT icon toward the bottom of the left sidebar. Clicking on the LOGOUT icon logs you out of the Globus file manager web app. To logout from the Globus service, select the Globus ID "Log Out" link.</span></p>

This can be done through the submission portal by selecting </span><code>Submit Publish Request</code><span> from the main menu of the submission portal. If an embargo period is being requested, please send an email to </span><a href="mailto:bil-support@psc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>bil-support@psc.edu</span></a><span> along with the submission id and brief note.</span></p><p><span>To submit your datasets for publication:</span></p><ol style="padding-left: 2em;">
<li><span>Log in to the submission portal </span><a href="https://submit.brainimagelibrary.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>https://submit.brainimagelibrary.org/</span></a></li>
<li><span>On the top navigation bar, select "Submit Publish Request"</span></li>
<li><span>Select the submission you would like to publish from the list by selecting the check box on the left</span></li>
<li><span>Select "Submit Validation Request"</span></li>
</ol><p><span>If data validation fails, the data submitter will be notified by email. The submitter should address the validation issue(s) and re-submit the validation request. Both data and metadata need to pass the validation checks </span><span class="smartypants">–</span><span> datasets that fail the validation process are considered incomplete and will not be made publicly available.</span></p><h3 id="Glossary" data-id="Glossary" style=""><strong><span>Glossary</span></strong></h3><p><span>The following terms in this document have specific context, as defined below:</span></p><p><strong><span>Dataset</span></strong><br>
<span>At BIL a dataset is a stand-alone entry of an </span><em><span>image-volume or image-set</span></em><span> associated with a </span><em><span>single subject or experimental unit with unique</span></em><span> metadata. A single dataset is usually associated with a single donor or subject when submitting multiple subjects in a submission, or a single part of the brain when imaging many parts of the brain in a submission. Many datasets make up a submission. A dataset typically contains many 2d image files that are assembled to form a more complex two or three-dimensional volume.</span></p><p><strong><span>Submission</span></strong><br>
<span>A submission contains one or more related datasets and the associated metadata. Submissions will inherit project metadata (such as the NIH project, grant number, laboratory name, etc.), thus all datasets within a submission must belong to the same project. A submission can contain a single or multiple datasets. In general, smaller submissions are recommended because all datasets within a submission must pass the validation process for the datasets within the submission to be published. Each "level" of data should be uploaded in separate submissions (e.g. The set of raw data and the same data aligned to a reference are considered two separate submissions).</span></p><p><strong><span>Project</span></strong><br>
<span>A way of grouping submissions to ensure that (1) People working with the data gain appropriate access and credit for their contributions and (2) Data is linked to the proper funding sources.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sub-Project</span></strong><br>
<span>A way of grouping data within a BIL Project to link data of the same funding source, and to group data from the same emperiment or scientific project.</span></p><p><strong><span>Publish</span></strong><br>
<span>The act of making a submission that has passed all validation checks publicly available.</span></p></div>
